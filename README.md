# Inheritance-part-2
Another inheritance project that uses object orientation to simulate a library, the checking in and out of books. 
A library has many type of materials to lend to patrons. Books, videos and DVDs are three types of these materials. 
All three have titles, but books have an author while videos and DVD have a director. 
Each can be lent out to a patron for 10 days (books) or 20 days (videos or DVDs).

This project basically takes in a date and add the appropriate number of days until the entity is due.
